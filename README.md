# 🚀 Python Operators 

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates various Python operators with examples. It covers:
✅ Arithmetic Operators
✅ Assignment Operators
✅ Comparison Operators
✅ Logical Operators
✅ Bitwise Operators

✅ Membership Operators


## 🔢 Operators Demonstrated
### ➕ Arithmetic Operators
Performs mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
```python
print(10 + 3)  # Output: 13
```

### 🔍 Comparison Operators
Used to compare values (True/False).
```python
a = 10  
b = 20  
print(a == b)  # False (Equal to)
```

### 🔗 Logical Operators
Used for combining conditions.
```python
x = 5  
y = 10  
print(x > 3 and y < 20)  # True (Both conditions are True)
```
